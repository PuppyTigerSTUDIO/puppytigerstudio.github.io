## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using the TesMirror app ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 2. Service Overview

TesMirror is an app that mirrors your Android smartphone screen to the Tesla vehicle's browser via local network and allows you to control your smartphone using the Tesla touchscreen.

---

## 3. Requirements and Data Security

The App requires Android 10 or higher.

Your Tesla vehicle must be connected to the same network as your smartphone via hotspot (tethering) for mirroring to work.

**Data Security**: All screen and audio data being mirrored is streamed in real-time exclusively within the user's local network without passing through any external servers. PuppyTigerStudio does not collect, store, or access the user's screen content.

You must grant the requested permissions (screen recording, accessibility service, notifications, foreground service, etc.) for the App to function properly.

## 4. Accessibility Service Usage

The App uses the Android Accessibility Service to provide remote touch control from the Tesla touchscreen.

- The Accessibility Service is used **solely for the purpose of executing touch inputs received from the Tesla browser on the smartphone**.
- No personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted through the Accessibility Service.
- You acknowledge that you understand the implications of this permission and grant it at your own discretion.
