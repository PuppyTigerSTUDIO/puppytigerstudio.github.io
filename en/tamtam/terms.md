**Last Updated: 2026-02-02**

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using the TamTam app ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

---

## 2. Service Overview

TamTam is a service that allows you to set countdown timers using a circular drag interface and receive vibration and sound alerts, even while running in the background.

---

## 3. Requirements and Data Security

**Local Data Storage**: All data you enter in the App, including timer settings, presets, and theme preferences, is stored exclusively on your device. PuppyTigerStudio does not collect or store user data on external servers.

**Required Permissions**: The App may require permissions such as notifications, vibration, keep screen on, and background execution (including battery optimization exemption) to function properly. If you do not grant these permissions, timer notification features may be limited.

---

## 4. Notification and Alarm Disclaimer (Important)

**Operating Environment Limitations**: The App's notifications are affected by device settings (silent mode, do not disturb mode, power saving mode), OS background management policies, and manufacturer battery optimization settings. The operator does not guarantee immediate and accurate alarm operation in all environments.

**Background Execution**: The device's operating system may forcefully terminate the App to reclaim system resources. The operator assumes no liability for timer interruptions caused by such termination.

**Liability Disclaimer for Damages**: PuppyTigerStudio assumes no liability for any actual damages (such as cooking failures, missed appointments, work delays, or other financial losses) caused by missed, delayed, or malfunctioning timer notifications. For important schedules, we recommend using a separate alarm method in addition to this App.

---

## 5. Prohibited Activities

You shall not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App to extract source code
- Create derivative works or copy, modify, or redistribute the App without authorization
- Use the App for illegal purposes or place excessive burden on the system

---

## 6. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the App's unique UI design (circular drag interface), logos, code, and content belong to PuppyTigerStudio.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services for service improvement, each subject to their respective policies:

- **Google AdMob**: For advertisements ([Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms))
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: For error analysis and quality improvement ([Firebase Terms of Service](https://firebase.google.com/terms))

---

## 8. Disclaimer

- The App is provided "AS IS" without any warranties regarding fitness for a particular purpose or error-free operation.
- The operator assumes no obligation or liability for data loss caused by device changes, device malfunction, or user negligence such as settings reset.
- PuppyTigerStudio is exempt from liability for any direct, indirect, or special damages arising from use of this App.

---

## 9. Service Changes

PuppyTigerStudio may modify or discontinue the App at any time without prior notice, as needed for operational purposes.

---

## 10. Changes to Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time and will be posted within the App or on the relevant page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

---

## 11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Suwon District Court, Seongnam Branch.
